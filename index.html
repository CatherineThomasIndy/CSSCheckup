        <H1>All About Gnomes</H1>
        <p id=opening>Gnomes are said to have emigrated long ago from the First World, the realm of the fey. 
            They are said to be eccentric, bizarre, obsessive, or even naive. Compounded with their unique personality 
            are their strange features such as spindly limbs, vibrantly-colored hair, and their expressive faces.

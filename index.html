        <H1>All About Gnomes</H1>
        <p id=opening>Gnomes are said to have emigrated long ago from the First World, the realm of the fey. 
            They are said to be eccentric, bizarre, obsessive, or even naive. Compounded with their unique personality 
            are their strange features such as spindly limbs, vibrantly-colored hair, and their expressive faces.

            <h3>Physical Description</h3>
            <p>Most gnomes are slightly above 3 feet tall and scarcely weigh more than a human child of similar height. 
                Virtually any hair and eye color other than white is possible. Skin tones tend toward earthy tones, pink hues, 
                green, black, or pale blue. Gnomes reach adulthood at the age of 18; while a gnome can theoretically live 
                indefinitely, they rarely live longer than 400 years.
